**Low frequency vibration isolator for weight loads from 1 to 130 lbs. and 1/2 Hz performance vertical and horizontal.**

Minus K's new LC-4 is an ultra compact, low-frequency negative-stiffness isolator. It comes in two configurations, our low horizontal frequency performance of 1.5 Hz or our ultra low horizontal frequency performance of 0.5 Hz. Both configurations offer our signature 0.5 Hz vertical natural frequency.

The LC-4 isolators can be combined into multi isolator systems to support heavier payloads while taking up very little room themselves. The isolators are passive, manually-adjustable and require no air or electricity.

If needed, the LC-4 isolators can be customized to achieve user specific needs. Eg., different horizontal and vertical frequencies, damping, etc. They can also be made cleanroom and vacuum. compatible.
**For International Orders, A Handling Fee of 5% is Added.
