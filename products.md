      <h3>NEW LC-4 Ultra Compact Vibration Isolators</h3>
      <p>Minus K's new LC-4 is an ultra compact, low-frequency negative-stiffness isolator. It comes in two configurations, our low horizontal performance of 1.5 Hz horizontal or the ultra low frequency 0.5 Hz horizontal. Both configurations offer our signature 0.5 Hz vertical natural frequency.</p>

      <p>The LC-4 isolators can be combined into multi isolator systems to support heavier payloads while taking up very little room themselves. The isolators are passive, manually-adjustable and require no air or electricity.</p>
